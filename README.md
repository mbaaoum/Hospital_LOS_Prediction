# Hospital_LOS_Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict patient Length of Stay (LOS) at HealthPlus hospital. Analyzed key factors influencing LOS and provided actionable insights to improve resource management, healthcare infrastructure, and revenue optimization.

# Context:
Hospital management, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has become critically important, with resource allocation such as beds and ventilators playing a vital role in patient outcomes. Accurately predicting the Length of Stay (LOS) for patients before admission can help hospitals optimize the use of resources, plan appropriate treatments, and allocate staff effectively, ultimately reducing LOS and improving recovery rates. At HealthPlus hospital, inefficient management of resources has led to significant revenue losses and compromised patient care. Developing a system to estimate patient LOS could greatly alleviate these issues.

# Project Overview:
In this project, I was tasked with analyzing patient data to identify the most significant factors affecting Length of Stay (LOS) at HealthPlus hospital. I developed a machine learning model to predict LOS using data available at the time of admission and after initial tests. My analysis also yielded valuable insights and recommendations aimed at improving the hospital's resource management, enhancing healthcare infrastructure, and optimizing revenue.
